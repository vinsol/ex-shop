## What will be NectarCommerce

>
Off-the-shelf Opensource E-commerce application for building an online store.
>
Provides an Extension Framework to support features not included in core as extensions.
>
Strives for unobtrusive parallel development of NectarCommerce and Extensions

NectarCommerce is committed to providing a ready-to-use e-commerce solution but the definition of 100% is different under different business domains. It aims to solve common use-cases as part of the project and relying on extension framework to tap the rest.

## Phoenix View Extension

### Why

We want to allow Extensions to provide alternate view for an existing view in Nectar or provide an alternate template path for all views without changing the Nectar Views.

### How

>
Note: Please refer [Introduction to Metaprogramming](http://vinsol.com/blog/2016/04/14/introduction-to-metaprogramming/) for more information on Metaprogramming in Elixir

## Alternate View Templates Path than Default for all templates override

To fully understand the changes below, please refer [Phoenix View Implementation](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/view.ex#L136)

It simply defines the function which adds the function which would check in custom path for templates and if not found will fallback to default view paths :)

## Only Few Template Overrides than all

**Note:** This section would be very similar to [Ecto Model Support Functions Extension](http://vinsol.com/blog/2016/04/18/ecto-model-support-functions-extension/), so only complete code-snippets are shown and not incremental walkthrough

Check the [library code](#library_code), [service code](#service_code) and [consumer code](#consumer_code) as used with [favorite products extension](#extension_code)

_Our aim with these posts is to start a dialog with the Elixir community on validity and technical soundness of our approach. We would really appreciate your feedback and reviews, and any ideas/suggestions/pull requests for improvements to our current implementation or entirely different and better way to do things to achieve the goals we have set out for NectarCommerce._

_Enjoy the Elixir potion !!_
