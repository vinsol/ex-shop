## What will be NectarCommerce

>
Off-the-shelf Opensource E-commerce application for building an online store.
>
Provides an Extension Framework to support features not included in core as extensions.
>
Strives for unobtrusive parallel development of NectarCommerce and Extensions

NectarCommerce is committed to providing a ready-to-use e-commerce solution but the definition of 100% is different under different business domains. It aims to solve common use-cases as part of the project and relying on extension framework to tap the rest.

## Ecto Model Support Functions Extension

>
**Note:** This blog post is very similar to [Ecto Model Schema Extension](http://vinsol.com/blog/2016/04/15/ecto-model-schema-extension/),
you can wish to jump straight to [final version](#final_version)

### Why

We want to allow Extensions to add functions to existing Nectar Models without changing the Nectar Models.

### How

Minimum three parts are needed to create & use an extension effectively:

- Library Code
- Service Code
- Consumer Code

An extension and its use with Nectar can be viewed as Producer / Consumer relationship bound by a communication protocol.

**Extension** which wants to add a function, say fn\_from\_outside to Nectar Product Model, is a **Producer (Service Code)**.

**Nectar Model** is a **Consumer (Consumer Code)** allowing the new function additions through a **communication protocol (Library Code)**

Let's begin the journey of incremental changes to bring consumer, service and library code into existence starting from a simple use-case of adding a function, say `fn_from_outside`, to Nectar Product.

1.  A straightforward way to add a function, say fn\_from\_outside, to Nectar Product would be adding it directly in Nectar.Product, but it requires change in Nectar source. Let's move to the next step for avoiding any modification to Nectar.Product

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/a0608017b19c05337e71bd79231e3562bf190131.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Like, other extensions, adding a function to Nectar Model and importing it would not solve our purpose of calling function as `Nectar.Product.fn_from_outside`.
    `import <Module>` makes the `<Module>` functions available inside the module and can only be called inside Module and not from outside like `Nectar.Product.fn_from_outside`

    As expected, Elixir is well-aware of the use-case and provides `@before_compile <Module>` hook to inject functions in Modules as if their own and can be called as  `Nectar.Product.fn_from_outside`, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/de73b334b169009ec247ae15d0e10707c9e1ee55). See Nectar.ExtendProduct example below on how to use it.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/c0d7f9f2aedaacffb8ca26fb778839e05d0ad868.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/0f3a8d81e636a5e2a1b138e2a0eb0ddf545bfa0d.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Now, with `@before_compile Nectar.ExtendProduct` in place, we can work towards providing a way to register the new functions, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/2e7b4ee7ce7b76a70440ca256c612307e786c52c). Please check the usage of Module attributes for same below.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/8a9cc9d0f3f9b33fd3516ec3b0bd625946b7fe1d.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Earlier, Module.put_attribute was used multiple times to define many functions whereas now we wrapped it in an anonymous function to encapsulate the collection of function additions through a simple and consistent interface, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/0f75aef16bf12000068d331d5a4147c0a6f819d0). There can be multiple extensions used for different functionality and hence many functions need to be registered and defined

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/020dd42284c391e64bac9b4a14c3a3bb97a0f621.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Now, Nectar.ExtendProduct is getting cluttered with ancillary method definitions. Let's move it out to another module and use it, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/d9883af5365109c349363ffa38e2a13ad30bc9d2)

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/447cdad10471f9ab7c47c0352070ae00dde12f03.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Let's further reduce the boilerplate of registering method_block module attribute and importing include_method method definition with __using__ callback, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/1ba90f0e6e86e87c1e116d62d8e9eaf4ee42b37c)

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/2125c83a64300b108c21048a35b8436d3f281764.js"></script>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/ad4a872557c8906389198e0ba3aafde3dd69fac4.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Reference of method_block Module attribute is scattered across Nectar.ExtendProduct and Nectar.ModelExtension so let's move it out to Nectar.ModelExtension to consolidate the usage via `__before_compile__` and definition together, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/8b21ccb99dbdb507c25b5e9d3f3fdfe72fc8bec1)

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/71a8f9cce9f4d3607ac2e0ee35123404bbd8b6dc.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  Now, `Nectar.ExtendProduct` is having `__using__` macro definition, which can also be moved to `Nectar.ModelExtension` to just have new method defintions in `Nectar.ExtendProduct`, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/b985b7af90e558773d974bcb34658eae222ea2b7)

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/e2dc2266dfecd0e35bfebdd5c39a88df1b291fc9.js"></script>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/c5aa7869610b006653bdae9e00cf360e/2cbcedac70352d0f83c358669381084b946bcb8b.js"></script>

1.  With above changes, it's now possible to define any number of functions, see full version [here](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba/56e57c15324c99c7355e6d418cf7286a0d1afbeb). Also, any number of functions can now be added using `include_method` in Nectar.ExtendProduct without making any changes to Nectar.Product.

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/pikender/a60a3c193f3077f648daa6f81f2c5f17/fcb09e32bb34d11d78833895fe321228c40eb6e7.js"></script>

<a name="final_version">&nbsp;</a> Now, in the [final version](https://gist.github.com/pikender/892fd3707043bacecc73ad24ba45cdba), you can easily find the three components, _consumer, service and library code_, as desired in extensible system

_Our aim with these posts is to start a dialog with the Elixir community on validity and technical soundness of our approach. We would really appreciate your feedback and reviews, and any ideas/suggestions/pull requests for improvements to our current implementation or entirely different and better way to do things to achieve the goals we have set out for NectarCommerce._

_Enjoy the Elixir potion !!_
