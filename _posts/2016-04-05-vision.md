## What will be NectarCommerce

>
Off-the-shelf Opensource E-commerce application for building online store.
>
Provides an Extension Framework to support features not included in core as extensions.
>
Strives for un-obstrusive parallel development of NectarCommerce and Extensions

NectarCommerce is committed to provide a ready-to-use e-commerce solution but definition of 100% is different under different business domains.

NectarCommerce aims to solve common use-cases as part of the project and relying on extension framework to tap the rest.

Vision
======

**E-commerce Framework with an extension methodology which allows easy integration of custom features unique to the domain.**

## NectarCommerce in NutShell

[NectarCommerce](https://github.com/vinsol/nectarcommerce) is an E-commerce Elixir/Phoenix Application which is currently having following features:

- Product Management
- Order Management
- Basic Stock Management

Please check out the [demo](https://github.com/vinsol/nectarcommerce#demo) and [README](https://github.com/vinsol/nectarcommerce/blob/master/README.md)

## NectarCommerce and Extensions

The project is in its early stages where NectarCommerce and extensions are residing side-by-side in _Elixir umbrella app_.

Our plan is to evolve where NectarCommerce and all other extensions will be mix projects/applications which may have web components via [phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), which can be downloaded as hex packages.

Once ready, NectarCommerce should provide an [Extension Framework](https://github.com/vinsol/nectarcommerce/pull/47), where custom features as needed per domain can be developed and integrated back to NectarCommerce with minimal effort and no _noticeable_ impact on runtime performance

The extensions should seamlessly integrate via Extensions Framework with NectarCommerce such that changes in extensions will not demand a change in NectarCommerce and extensions can incrementally adapt to changes in NectarCommerce for better support, new features and betterments.

NectarCommerce and extensions can be grown and developed in isolations, wherein, NectarCommerce is developed by one team and extensions probably by many different teams where no one team will own all the extensions and NectarCommerce.


Our aim with these posts is to start a dialog with the Elixir community on validity and technical soundness of our approach. We would really appreciate your feedback and reviews, and any ideas/suggestions/pull requests for improvements to our current implementation or entirely different and better way to do things to achieve the goals we have set out for NectarCommerce.

_Enjoy the Elixir potion !!_
