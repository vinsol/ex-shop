### What will be NectarCommerce

>
Off-the-shelf Opensource E-commerce application for building an online store.
>
Provides an Extension Framework to support features not included in core as extensions.
>
Strives for unobtrusive parallel development of NectarCommerce and Extensions

NectarCommerce is committed to providing a ready-to-use e-commerce solution but the definition of 100% is different under different business domains. It aims to solve common use-cases as part of the project and relying on extension framework to tap the rest.

# Metaprogramming in Elixir

_Note:_ If you are already familiar and experienced with Elixir Metaprogramming, you can jump to [last section](#last-section) as it lists Metaprogramming resources
and constructs used in upcoming blogs when creating different extension DSL's.

**Elixir _docs_** are excellent resources to get familiar with Metaprogramming:

- [Quote and unquote](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/quote-and-unquote.html)
- [Macros](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html)
- [Domain Specific Languages](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/domain-specific-languages.html)

Check out **Understanding Elixir Macros _blog_ series** by [@sasajuric](https://twitter.com/sasajuric)

- [Understanding Elixir Macros, Part 1 - Basics](http://theerlangelist.com/article/macros_1)
- [Understanding Elixir Macros, Part 2 - Micro Theory](http://theerlangelist.com/article/macros_2)
- [Understanding Elixir Macros, Part 3 - Getting into the AST](http://theerlangelist.com/article/macros_3)

- [Understanding Elixir Macros, Part 5 - Reshaping the AST](http://theerlangelist.com/article/macros_5)
- [Understanding Elixir Macros, Part 6 - In-place Code Generation](http://theerlangelist.com/article/macros_6)

[**_Book_** Metaprogramming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir) by [@chris_mccord](https://twitter.com/chris_mccord) is next step for deep dive into metaprogramming.

Why another tutorial on already well-documented metaprogramming topic ?

**To revise and refresh something that we would refer time and again when reviewing Model, Router, View extension DSLs**

Extension DSLs will be using below constructs to get the job done :)

- [Module.register_attribute/3](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Module.html#register_attribute/3)
  - Registers an attribute. By registering an [attribute](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/module-attributes.html), a developer is able to customize how Elixir will store and accumulate the attribute values.
- [Module.put_attribute/3](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Module.html#put_attribute/3)
  - Puts an Erlang attribute to the given module with the given key and value
- [@before_compile](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Module.html)
  - A hook `__before_compile__/1` that will be invoked before the module is compiled
  - It allows us to inject code into the module when its definition is complete
- [\_\_using\_\_ hook](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Kernel.html#use/2)
  - Find the documentation under the `examples for the usage, context and best practices` in link above
  - `use ModuleName` looks and invokes `__using__` macro defined in `ModuleName` module
- [bind_quoted](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#quote/2)
  - Find the documentation under the `bind_quoted option` in the link above
  - By using `bind_quoted`, we can automatically disable unquoting while still injecting the desired variables into the tree
- [Code.ensure_loaded?/1](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Code.html#ensure_loaded?/1)
  - Ensures the given module is loaded
- [apply/3](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Kernel.html#apply/2)
  - Invokes the given `function` from `module` with the array of arguments `args`.
- [Macro.escape/1](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Macro.html#escape/2)
  - Recursively escapes a value so it can be inserted into a syntax tree

#### <a name="last-section">Metaprogramming pattern as used across extensions</a>

There are three parts needed at minimum to create & use an extension effectively:

- Library Code
- Service Code
- Consumer Code

An extension and its use with Nectar can be viewed as Producer / Consumer relationship bound by a communication protocol.

**Extension** which want to add a route, say a list of favorites, is a **Producer (Service Code)**.

**Nectar Router** is a **Consumer (Consumer Code)** allowing the route additions through a **communication protocol (Library Code)**

- **Library code** defines a macro providing a DSL, say `define_route`
- Collect all definitions provided using DSL from **Service code** in Module attribute, say `defined_routes`
- **Library code** defines a `before_compile` hook to add a macro extracting all collected definitions from module attribute, as module attributes are cleaned up as compilation completes
- Inject generated code into targeting module **Consumer code** through `__using__` hook as invoked by `use ModuleWithDSLImplementation`, say `use ExtensionsManager.RouterExtension`

_Our aim with these posts is to start a dialog with the Elixir community on validity and technical soundness of our approach. We would really appreciate your feedback and reviews, and any ideas/suggestions/pull requests for improvements to our current implementation or entirely different and better way to do things to achieve the goals we have set out for NectarCommerce._

_Enjoy the Elixir potion !!_
